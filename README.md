## Overview

**Ascending To Agony** is a challenging 2D platformer inspired by the "Getting Over It" genre. Players must navigate a dangerous environment to reach the goal at the top of the map using a unique movement mechanic: shooting bullets in one direction propels you in the opposite direction. Master momentum and precision to survive turrets, rotating saws, spike traps, and other deadly obstacles.

## Features

- **Physics-Based Movement** - Shoot bullets to control your momentum and navigate the level
- **Bullet Management** - Limited ammunition that regenerates when grounded and stationary
- **Developer Terminal** - Runtime debugging console with commands to modify gameplay parameters
- **Hazardous Environments** - Turrets, rotating saws, spike traps, and pressure plates
